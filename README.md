1. Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to use Python 3.x.

2. pygame: Pygame is a popular library for creating 2D games and multimedia applications, including audio playback. To install pygame, you can use pip:
            pip install pygame

3. tkinter (Optional): If you want to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your music player, you can use the tkinter module, which is included with Python. You don't need to install it separately.

4.  Music Files: You'll need a collection of music files (e.g., MP3) that you want to play with your music player. Make sure you have a folder with music files to test your player.
